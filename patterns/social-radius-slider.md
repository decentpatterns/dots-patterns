## Why Choose Social Radius Slider? 

To more accurately reflect real-world social interactions and group dynamics.

## The Design Problem 

Social networks are mentally taxing. Sometimes news from around the world is inspiring, other times it is just depressing. Sometimes you want to hear from
strangers, other times you just want posts from your closest friends and family. Wanting to proactively manage your feed for your mental health requires a lot
of overhead.

## The Design Solution 

Use a radius to indicate how "big" your circle is for today.

### Examples 
- Information bubble 
- Google+

## Best Practice: How to Implement Social Radius Slider
- Social Radius Slider is a temporary filter and doesn't have to be persistent. It allows users to control and extend their network as well as to moderate their data consumption.

## The Design Problem

When wanting to grant access to a resource in a decentralized system, we can't
necessarily depend on a trusted single central controller. Instead, we use
cryptographicly-secure secret passwords, or "keys," that grant access to
resources. A reosurce could be an account, a group invitation, or a piece of data.

These cryptographically-secure keys can be very large, sometimes hundreds of
characters. Because of this, it can be difficult to save or share these keys
in the physical world.

## The Design Solution

The user can save or print a file that can be used to gain access to the
resource. The file itself should be easily human readable and printable.

You can use this in conjunction with the [QR Code
verification](QR-code-verification.md) pattern to make it easier to import the
codes with the device's camera.

### Examples

- Disk encryption recovery keys (Apple)
- 2FA backup codes, (GitHub, Lastpass)
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-new-key-model)
- [Delta Chat](https://deltachat) burner account codes.

## Why Choose Paper Keys?

Paper Keys is a safe and accessible method to verify, share, or backup information.

## Best Practice: How to Implement Paper Keys

It is advisable that users know the risks, and have a secure and oragnised
place to store the keys. Be clear with users that they should print it or
save it in a safe backup location in case their device gets lost or stolen.

## Potential Problems with Paper Keys

If lost, access to data is potentially lost permanently.

If found by an adversary, it can lead to unauthorized access to data.
